  # Fix RLS policies for orders table

  1. Security Changes
    - Update existing RLS policies to allow both authenticated and anonymous users

    - Maintains data security while allowing necessary operations

  2. Policy Updates
    - Modified SELECT policy to allow anonymous access
    - Modified INSERT policy to allow anonymous access  
    - Modified UPDATE policy to allow anonymous access
